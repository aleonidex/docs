# Assigning a role to a user

[Organization administrators and owners](add-org-admin.md) can assign roles in {{ org-full-name }}. You can assign to users not just organization management roles but also roles for access to your organization's connected cloud resources.

For information on roles available in {{ yandex-cloud }} and their associated permissions, please review the {{ iam-full-name }} documentation, [{#T}](../../iam/roles-reference.md).

- {{ cloud-center }} interface {#cloud-center}

  {% include [assign-role-to-user](../../_includes/organization/assign-role-to-user.md) %}

- CLI {#cli}

  {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  1. Select the role you want to assign.

  1. [Get the user ID](../operations/users-get.md).

  1. Assign the role using the command:

      ```bash
      yc <service_name> <resource> add-access-binding <resource_name_or_ID> \
        --role <role_ID> \
        --subject <subject_type>:<subject_ID>
      ```

      Where:

      * `<service_name>`: Name of the service for whose resource you assign the role, e.g., `organization-manager`.
      * `<resource>`: Resource category. For an organization, it is always `organization`.
      * `<resource_name_or_ID>`: Resource name or ID. For an organization, use its [technical name](../operations/org-profile.md).
      * `--role`: Role ID.
      * `--subject`: Type and ID of the [subject](../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md#subject) getting the role.

      For example, this command assigns a user the administrator role for a directory with the `b1gmit33ngp3********` ID:

      ```bash
      yc recource-manager folder add-access-binding b1gmit33ngp3******** \
        --role resource-manager.admin \
        --subject userAccount:aje6o61dvog2********
      ```

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

  {% include [terraform-install](../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

  1. Describe the parameters of the roles you assign in the configuration file:

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_organizationmanager_organization_iam_binding" "editor" {
        organization_id = "<organization_ID>"
        role = "<role_ID>"
        members = [
          "federatedUser:<user_ID>",
        ]
      }
      ```

      Where:

      * `organization_id`: [Organization ID](./organization-get-id.md).
      * `role`: Role you want to assign. For each role, you can only use one `yandex_organization manager_organization_iam_binding` resource.
      * `members`: Array of the IDs of users to assign the role to:

        * `userAccount:<user_ID>`: Yandex user account ID.
        * `federatedUser:<user_ID>`: Federated user ID.

      For more information about the resources you can create with {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}/).

  1. Create resources:

      {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}

  The specified user will then get roles in the organization. You can check the new role in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).

- API {#api}

  To assign a role, use the `updateAccessBindings` REST API method for the appropriate resource:

  1. Select the role you want to assign.

  1. [Get the user ID](../operations/users-get.md).

  1. Create the request body, e.g., in the `body.json` file. In the `action` property, enter `ADD` and specify the `userAccount` or `federatedUser` type and user ID under `subject`.

      ```json
      {
        "accessBindingDeltas": [{
          "action": "ADD",
          "accessBinding": {
            "roleId": "<role_ID>",
            "subject": {
              "id": "gfei8n54hmfh********",
              "type": "userAccount"
            }
          }
        }]
      }
      ```

  1. Assign the role. For example, for an organization with the `bpf3crucp1v2********` ID:

      ```bash
      export ORGANIZATION_ID=bpf3crucp1v2********
      export IAM_TOKEN=<IAM_token>
      curl \
        --request POST \
        --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
        --data '@body.json' \
        "https://organization-manager.{{ api-host }}/organization-manager/v1/organizations/${ORGANIZATION_ID}:updateAccessBindings"
      ```

{% endlist %}

In a similar way, you can [assign roles](../../iam/operations/sa/assign-role-for-sa.md#binding-role-organization) for an organization to a service account.
